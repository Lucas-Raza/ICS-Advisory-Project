# Welcome #

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to this open source project!  If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue.  The worst that can happen is that
you'll be politely asked to change something.  We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.
