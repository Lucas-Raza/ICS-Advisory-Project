# Welcome #

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to the ICS Advisory open source project!  If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue.  The worst that can happen is that
you'll be politely asked to change something.  We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read this CONTRIBUTING policy, our [LICENSE](LICENSE), and [README](README.md), all of which should be in this repository.
