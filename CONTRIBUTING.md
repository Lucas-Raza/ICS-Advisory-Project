# Welcome #

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to the ICS Advisory open source project!  If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue.  The worst that can happen is that
you'll be politely asked to change something.  We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read this CONTRIBUTING policy, our [LICENSE](LICENSE), and [README](README.md), all of which should be in this repository.

## Issues ##

If you want to report a bug or request a new feature, the most direct method is to [create an issue](https://github.com/icsadvprj/ICS-Advisory-Project/issues) in this
repository.  We recommend that you first search through existing issues (both open and closed) to check if your particular issue has already been reported.  If it has then you might want to add a comment to the existing issue.  If it hasn't then feel free to create a new one.
