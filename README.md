# ICS Advisory Project ##
The ICS Advisory Project is an open-source project to provide clean and usable DHS CISA ICS-CERT Advisory data in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format. This format will support vulnerability analysis that is difficult to perform in the current ICS-CERT Advisory HTML format. The ICS-CERT Advisory data will also support the other project goal: the ICS Advisory Project: ICS-CERT Advisory Dashboard. The dashboard provides smaller OT/ICS assets owners with a tool to quickly filter the view of vulnerabilities affecting vendors/products within their environment. This project is by no means a replacement for the original CISA ICS-CERT Advisory, and I highly recommend anyone using this data set to refer to and read them.

While some of this dataset may seem duplicative of CVE data, CISA ICS-CERT Advisories have been providing additional insight not provided in a CVE, such as Vendor headquarters locations, Product distributions, and Critical Infrastructure sectors for each vendor product. This additional data is valuable to Security and Industry researchers to understand potential supply chain risks associated with vendor production locations and vulnerabilities across specific critical infrastructure sectors. However, as you see, the Critical Infrastructure Sector data still requires work to allow this trending. Part of this effort, with contributor help, will clean up the Critical infrastructure data to filter down to specific industry sectors such as Energy, Water, Wastewater Treatment, Transportation, and more.

This project is a community effort: don't hesitate to contact ICSAdvisoryproject@gmail.com if you have questions about contributing or want to support the improvement, expansion, maintenance, and protection of this data source. Here is the link to [contribution guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md) for updating and maintaining the ICS-CERT Advisory data set.
