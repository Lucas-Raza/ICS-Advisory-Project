# ICS-Advisory-Project
The ICS Advisory Project is an open-source project to provide DHS CISA ICS-CERT Advisory data in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format to support vulnerability analysis that is not easily done in their current HTML format. This is a community effort: please contribute to improve, expand, maintain, and protect this data source. This project is not meant as a replacement for the original ICS-CERT Advisories.
Please refer to DHS CISA ICS-CERT Advisory as the core data source and for recommended mitigations for identified vendor/product vulnerabilities.
